                <p>My name is Fabrizio Carlassara, my friends and family call me Fabri. I am 27 years old and was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina. I am currently working as a High School Teacher, focusing on embedded systems and low level programming. I've been studying Electrical Engeneering since 2018 and this year (2025) I should be graduating. My goal is to continue studying until I reach a Masters Degree and my Bachelors Degree from BYU too. I am very passionate about coding and constantly learning new things.</p>

                <p>Argentina is a country rich in culture, history, and natural wonders. It is the birthplace of tango, a captivating dance and music genre that originated in Buenos Aires in the late 19th century. Football is almost a religion here, with legendary players like Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi inspiring millions. Argentina is also renowned for its cuisine, especially its world-famous beef and Malbec wine from the Mendoza region. The country has a diverse landscape, featuring the Andes mountains, the vast Pampas plains, and the stunning IguazÃº Falls, one of the world's largest waterfalls. Buenos Aires, its capital, is often called "the Paris of South America" due to its European-style architecture and vibrant cultural scene. Argentina is home to the world's southernmost city, Ushuaia, located in Tierra del Fuego. Additionally, the Perito Moreno Glacier in Patagonia is one of the few glaciers in the world that is still advancing. The country is also famous for its literary contributions, with writers like Jorge Luis Borges leaving a lasting impact on world literature. Lastly, Argentina boasts a high number of psychologists per capita, reflecting a cultural emphasis on mental health and well-being.</p>
